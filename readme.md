#### **About Data**
**`Description`**:\
This Data is taken from Kaggle DataSets - [Apple-App-Store](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/apple-appstore-apps)
#### **Task:**
We intend to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the given dataset. The EDA will serve as the basis for the necessary Data Wrangling activities to be carried out for the purposes of data cleaning and normalization. During the coding process, we will document our observations. Ultimately, we will produce a summary and draw conclusions from our findings

#### **Objectives:**
The primary aim of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify significant insights. The ultimate goal is to project and emphasize customer dynamics and demands to developers and other relevant stakeholders. This will assist in driving more business towards their upcoming applications.
